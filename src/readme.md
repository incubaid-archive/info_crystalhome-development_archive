## WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO

"We are a non profit organisation who strongly believe that the world needs affordable, sustainable and circular living and that this should be there for everyone"

We work for the planet first, and our planet needs a different approach on housing!

The linear "take, make, waste" economic model is reaching its limits. The environment simply does not have the capacity to sustain it any more. A circular approach creates an economy thatâ€™s both sustainable and profitable.
