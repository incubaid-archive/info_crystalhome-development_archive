# Why We Do What We Do

"We are a non profit organisation who strongly believe that the world needs affordable, sustainable and circular living and that this should be there for everyone"

We work for the planet first, and our planet needs a different approach on housing!

The linear "take, make, waste" economic model is reaching its limits. The environment simply does not have the capacity to sustain it any more. A circular approach creates an economy thatâ€™s both sustainable and profitable.

## Partnership With ThreeFold

Not only will the Threefold foundation support our mission but all the homes will be equipped with a 3bot, which will be used to handle all the technology that the house

will be provided with. Such as lighting, energy storage, heating and water management.

## Funding

The foundation is 100% funded by the pre-sell of future projects and loans provided by founders and believers, these loans are paid back as the units are delivered.
